#### Description
This is an <b>optimized</b> program to compute the gratest common divisor (GCD) of 2 given non-negative numbers.
The naive approach of finding GCD consumes enormous amount of time, such approaches fail in cases of very large numbers (in order of 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup>, etc.).<br>
Here, I have used Euclidean algorithm to calculate GCD. [Click on this link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm) to read more!

#### Example
Input:<br>
 28851538 1183019<br>
Output:<br>
 17657<br>

###### Explaination:
28851538 = 17657 Â· 1634, 1183019 = 17657 Â· 67
Thus, the answer is 17657.
